Its X shell. Its a UNIX shell.

It combines commands like echo, whoami, and pwd that are usually separate programs, into the shell directly, like BusyBox.
It is unable to do (as of now):

    1. Execute scripts or an .xshrc
    
    2. You cannot use the arrow keys to use a previous command
    
    3. To be production ready (yet)

BUT I will implement these things in a later release eventually (maybe v2.0.0-stable?).
